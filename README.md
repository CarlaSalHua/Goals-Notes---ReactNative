This project is about take notes or add new goals for studies, or daily activities.

1) Fork the project
2) Clone the project
3) npm start 
4) scan the expo QR (you should download the expo app first).
5) It doesn't works, try deleting the "node modules" and "package-lock.json"
6) npm install
7) again npm start and scan the QR. 

Hope i have helped with this project. ;)
